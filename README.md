#A tic tac toe terminal game in Ruby

-Game can be run from Terminal by typing "ruby tictactoe.rb" while in tic_tac_toe directory

-Algorithm for win detection works by calculating and saving all winning possible combinations based on the board grid size each time a new game is initialized. Algorithm then tests the combinations for a win (if either three x's or three o's exist in each combo) each time a player plays and also utilizes this algorithm to help make the computer smart when picking spaces for offense or defense.
